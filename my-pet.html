    <p>My family had our first pet dog named Diesel in August 2015. We booked him from a Labrador pedigree breeder two months before he was actually born. We were really thrilled to welcome him home eight weeks later after he was born.</p>
    <p>Diesel's liked to play a lot and would spend several hours everyday running around the compund.We enrolled him to a puppy class where he had to learn obedience.</strong>!</p>

    <p>Here are some toys that he liked to play with:<p/>
    <ol>
      <li>soccer ball</li>
      <li>bone</li>
      <li>stuffed animals</li>
      <li>And a lot more!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Labradors are very playful but also kid friendly. Click here for more on Labradors<a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/labrador-retriever/">Labrador Breed information</a>. This is a great place to learn more on this breed!</p>
